Atmospheric Extinction and Airmass Experiment (NPHY322)

This repository contains the code, data, and report for Experiment 9: Atmospheric Extinction and Airmass (ATM-EXT) conducted as part of the NPHY322 Physics Practical module.

*📌 Objective*

The aim of the experiment was to:

Measure atmospheric extinction,

Determine how starlight is absorbed/scattered by the Earth’s atmosphere,

Calculate airmass and extinction coefficients using multiple wavelength filters (Blue, Indigo, Violet, Ultraviolet, and Red).

🧪 Experiment Summary

We observed the star BD-124523 using a telescope equipped with a photometer and various filters. The instrumental magnitude and total flux were recorded over varying airmass values. These observations were then used to analyze:

Airmass vs. Total Flux

Airmass vs. Instrumental Magnitude

📊 Visualizations

Two main plots were generated:

Airmass vs. Total Flux – Showing how starlight intensity decreases with atmospheric depth.

Airmass vs. Instrumental Magnitude – Demonstrating the logarithmic relationship between magnitude and extinction.

📌 Key Findings

Extinction increases with airmass.

Observations are more accurate when celestial objects are near zenith.

The extinction coefficient varies depending on the wavelength (filter used).
